# AI poker bot based on research papers
# Approximates Nash Equilibrium with Monte Carlo Linear Counterfactual Regret Minimization
# Note:
#       Does NOT exploit bad play, plays according to an unexploitable strategy itself.
#       Exploiting bad play would actually open up bot to exploitation by others, therefore not NE.

#       MCCFR has "theoretical NE convergence guarantees in such a game [as poker]."
#       This article also describes MCCFR and Restricted Nash Response (RNR) for exploitation.
#       Could be interesting to apply these as well.
